## Will you steep the way into their hearts?

...Not really. This is not a dating sim, it's just a quirky fan-made visual novel, inspired by [Doki Doki Literature Club!](http://ddlc.moe) by Team Salvato.
I know, bummer. But hey, it features characters you probably know from the YouTube show GTLive:

* __Matthew__ - a Diet Coke addict whose puns will make you want to cringe out of existence,
* __Jason__ - an assertive livestream producer who is always there to help,
* __Chris__ - a fun-loving guy who always finds more creative ways to solve problems,
* and __Stephanie__ - a tea-drinking girl who flosses vigorously. That's me!

I'm super excited to meet you and I hope that after spending some quality time together we'll become best friends!

xoxo, Steph
